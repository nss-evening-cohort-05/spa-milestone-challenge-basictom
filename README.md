  The car data is loaded into a private array, looped through, and printed to DOM. Cars are printed into bootstraps predefined rows and columns. All the cars are Nissan Rogues, because why would I sell any other cars?

  When any part of the card is clicked on, the search file focus in with the cursor. When the user types into the input field the description of the selected card will mirror the input. WOOHOO. Tom <3's readme's.
